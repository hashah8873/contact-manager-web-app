Contact Manager Capstone Project
# Capstone Project Proposal

## Project Title
Contact Manager Web Application

## Introduction
The goal of this capstone project is to develop a simple Contact Manager web application that allows users to store and manage contact information in one centralized system. Many users rely on notes or multiple applications to save contact details, which can be inefficient and disorganized. This project aims to provide an easy-to-use web-based solution for managing contacts.

## Problem Statement
Many users need a simple and organized way to store contact information instead of using paper notes or multiple digital tools that are not centralized.

## Proposed Solution
This project will provide a web application that allows users to add, view, edit, and delete contacts. The application will use a backend built with PHP and MySQL to store contact data securely. In later phases, the frontend will be enhanced using Angular to improve interactivity and user experience.

## Core Features
- Add new contacts
- View a list of contacts
- Edit existing contacts
- Delete contacts

## Technologies to be Used
- PHP
- MySQL
- XAMPP
- Git and GitHub
- Adobe XD (for prototype design)
- Angular (later phase)

## Prototype Design and Navigation
A low-fidelity prototype of the Contact Manager web application was created using Adobe XD to visualize the layout and basic user flow. The prototype includes two main screens: a Contacts List page and an Add New Contact page.

Users can navigate from the Contacts List page to the Add New Contact page by clicking the Add Contact button. After entering the contact information, users can return to the Contacts List page by clicking the Save button. This navigation demonstrates the intended user interaction within the application.

## Project Plan
- Phase 1: Build backend using PHP and MySQL
- Phase 2: Integrate frontend using Angular
- Phase 3: Optional implementation using React
- Phase 4: Testing, improvements, and final presentation

## Learning Goals
Through this project, I aim to strengthen my backend development skills, improve my understanding of databases, and gain experience working with modern JavaScript frameworks and version control tools.
